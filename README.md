LearnHarness uses AI agents to plan and teach lessons from your current understanding to your goal. It builds a detailed picture of what you understand and how you reason. That picture is updated as you learn.

Instead of just giving you an explanation, it uses your answers and thinking to decide what you need next. Teaching builds understanding one reasoning step at a time. Practice makes it usable. A persistent knowledge graph carries it across sessions.

## T3Learn local desktop edition

This is an independent edition of [LearnHarness](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/learnharness), with [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code)-inspired provider and chat UI adaptations. Original attribution and AGPL licensing are preserved.

This checkout adds **Codex CLI** and **Claude Code** subscription connections alongside all existing API-key providers, plus a T3 Code-inspired chat layout. In Settings → Providers, choose **Use existing login** or **Sign in**, then select the CLI provider in your model settings.

Attach images and selected PDF pages as lesson context. Use **Add handwritten thinking** in answer fields to transcribe your working into an editable draft before submitting. See [attachments and learning storage](docs/learning-data.md).

Build your own macOS app with `npm ci` followed by `npm run desktop:local`. The app is written to `dist/local/mac-arm64/T3Learn.app` on Apple Silicon (`mac` on Intel). See [CLI setup and local macOS builds](docs/local-desktop.md) for details.

The **Progress** button beside Settings shows XP, levels, streaks, badges and knowledge-map counts without changing the learning system. See [learning data and private backups](docs/learning-data.md). Personal records and credentials do not belong in this public source repository.

## How it works

1. **Measure.** Before teaching, the agent finds where your understanding ends on each part the lesson depends on. Your answers, confidence, and thinking show it where to start.
2. **Plan.** It works out a dependency map from that starting point to your goal. You can see the plan, and the lesson adapts when your understanding turns out different.
3. **Teach.** Each step builds on something you already understand. You predict, get an explanation, and check your understanding. Confusions are repaired before anything is built on them. The aim is for the goal to feel obviously true, not merely familiar.
4. **Practice.** Separate sessions pose varied problems that require the right knowledge to come to mind without being named first. Problems and hints adapt to your reasoning.

**Think out loud.** The thinking fields let you explain your reasoning, uncertainties, and reactions in your own words. This is how the agent gets a detailed picture rather than just a record of right and wrong answers. You can type or use dictation.

The agent can also research questions in the background, create visual explanations, and build interactive demonstrations.

## Knowledge that carries forward

What you are taught accumulates as propositions and reasoning chains: individual claims and the premises that lead to them. The graph shows this structure, with links back to the source sessions. You can also import notes.

Future teaching sessions can read the graph instead of starting from scratch. Practice sessions can draw their material from it. It stores the ideas and their connections, not ratings of your ability.

## Download and get started

**[Download from learnharness.ai](https://learnharness.ai)** · [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/amosblomqvist/learnharness/releases)

- **macOS (Apple Silicon):** signed and notarized DMG. Drag the app to Applications.
- **Windows (x64):** run the installer. It is currently unsigned; Windows may show an “unknown publisher” or SmartScreen warning.
- **Linux (x64):** make the AppImage executable and open it, or install the Debian/Ubuntu `.deb`.

Add your provider API key and choose your models, then start a session with what you want to understand. LearnHarness supports 30+ provider options, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and OpenRouter. Optional dictation and web search use separate service keys.

All three platforms support in-app updates.

## Your keys, your data

- **Your keys and models.** No LearnHarness subscription or markup. You pay your providers for usage; a live cost meter shows model costs.
- **Local storage.** Your chats, graph, settings, and API keys live on your machine. Learning records are plain files you can inspect.
- **External services.** Models run through your configured providers. Model requests send the context needed for the task; web research and dictation also contact external services. Local storage does not mean offline processing.
- **Inspectable behavior.** System prompts are visible and editable. The app is open source under the AGPL-3.0 license.

## Development and support

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm test           # deterministic, no LLM, no network
```
